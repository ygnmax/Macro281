## Idea 1: The impact of fiscal policy on the inflation expectation

The papers [Durables and Size-Dependence in the Marginal Propensity to Spend](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32080) and [Lumpy Durable Consumption Demand and the Limited Ammunition of Monetary Policy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA18821) emphanize that the monetary policy and fiscal policy have impact on the consumption on durable goods. It reminds me that in the recent literature of the inflation expectation, it seems that not many papers distinguish the perish goods and durable goods in the inflation expectation, as far as I know.

It would be interesting for me to investigate how the fiscal policies, such as the stimulus checks or the change of government deficit, impact the inflation expectation through the realized and expected durable goods and non-durables goods consumption. The consumption data could be from micro panel in CEX and PSID. The consumption and inflation expectation and consumption expectation data could be from the Blue Chip economic indicator dataset.

There will be three sets of regressions. In the first regression, the RHS variable will be the change of government deficit, the LHS variable will be the change of durable and non-durable consumption. The coefficients reflect the response of the realized durable or non-durable consumption expenditure on fiscal shocks.

In the second set of regressions, the RHS variable will be the change of government deficit, the LHS variable will be the expected durable or non-durable consumption expenditure. These data are from Blue Chip economic indicator dataset and the financial analysts responds these questions. The coefficients reflect people's perception of fiscal impact on the expected durable, non-durable consumption expenditure and inflation.

The difference between the coefficients in the first and the second regression about the durable and non-durable consumption expenditure could be used to explain the forecast error and forecast revision in inflation expectation. 

In the third set of regressions, the RHS variable will be the expected durable and non-durable consumption expenditure. The LHS variable will be the expected inflation. This coefficient reflects how the inflation expectation is influenced by the expected durable consumption expenditure. Combing the first, second and third regressions helps us to understand how the inflation expectation is shaped by the fiscal policies.

## Idea 2: How does the subjective expectation on mortgage rate impact the mortgage supply?

Without loss of generality, in the competiive equilibrium in a representative agent model, the household maximize the utility and firms maximize the profit. There are banking sectors taking deposit and lending loans, with maximizing interest margin as target. During the formation of the equilibrium, because agents make their decisions simultaneously and without coordination or communication, they have to choose the optimal policy based on the expectation about the aggregated quantity variables. Because each agent is atomistic, its actions have no impact on the equilibrium price, the expectation about the aggregated quantity variables can be uniquely translated to the expectation on the price variables.

Then for bankers, we can estimate the sensitivity of the mortgage supply on the subjective mortgage rate, by linking the Bank Call Report data and Blue Chip Financial Forecast data. This sensitivity could help us to identify the parameter in the best response function of the aggregated variable. The LHS variable will be the log mortgage supply, the RHS variable will be the mortgage rate from the survey data. The variation is from different banks' subjective mortgage forecast across horizons and mortgage supply at each cross-section.

## Juan's thoughts.

I don't think that the assumption that banks are atomistic is a good assumption. The banking sector is concentrated, and bank clients do not have many outside options.
