## Idea 0: Effect of Securitization on Credit Supply (More details on Lask Week)

In the last week, I bring up the research question about the effect of securitization on credit supply. Maybe it is not clear enough and I want to explain it more. 

In the literature, such as [The role of securitization in bank liquidity and funding management](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.02.005) and [Securitization and the Declining Impact of Bank Finance on Loan Supply: Evidence from Mortgage Originations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01451.x), it shows that securitization reduces banks' holdings of liquid securities and increases their lending ability. 
This leads me to think that this channel could also appear at the regional level. Therefore, It would be interesting to see, whether the increase in the share of securitizatied loan over the whole loan, lead to more share of the non-securitization loans in the next period, at each region. 

To finance the development of the commercial real estate, the commercial mortgage loan highly depends on regional bank. Like [Work-From-Home, Commercial Real Estate Risk and
Credit Supply](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5200882),  by linking the mortgage origination data, such as CoreLogic and RCA, and the securization data, such as Trepp and Morningstar, it could be possible to narrow down the question above to: whether the increase in the share of securitization (CMBS) over the whole commercial mortgage loan, lead to more share of the non-securitization commercial mortgage supply in the next period, at each region.

## Idea 1: The dynamics of subjective Phillips curve
Based on the paper we read this week [The slope of the Phillips Curve: evidence from US states](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/137/3/1299/6529257) and [Optimal inflation and the identification of the Phillips curve](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/707181), the slope of phillips curve is flat and the empirical estimation may suffers from the identification. However, the inflation expectation components in the curve could be directly measured by survey. It is interesting to me whether we can estimate the subjective Phillips curve using individual forecasting data. For example, Survey of Professional Forecast and Blue Chip economic indicator provide the individual forecast on inflation, GDP, unemployment, and other macro variables at each cross-section with multiple forecast horizon. Even from the Beige Book, we can get the Fed view of current Phillips curve.

After estimating the subjective Phillips curves, we can compare it with the estimation using the realized data and compare how far or close between the subjective and realization. Then whether this wedge helps explain the Fed decisions in different economic conditions. How financial market prices these wedges between the subjective Phillips curve and objective Phillips curve, and the wedges between the market's subjective Phillips curve and Fed's subjective Phillips curve.

## Juan's thoughts.

I struggle to see what the subjective Phillips curve is. Is this idea about the formation of expectations?


## Idea 2: Estimation of Firm Phillips Curve using Firm Earning Calls
This week [Walmart announced that it will raise price due to the tariff](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/business/walmart-prices-tariffs). It is kind of common that many large firms will announce their pricing strategies and hiring-layoff plans, in the earning calls, quarter report, and general industial conference. If we can trace the pricing of retail companies in their earning calls, such as Target, Walmart, Costco, etc, or general speaking, the pricing of nontradeable goods companies, then we get a granular estimation of pricing. Then from the quarter report, we could have change of unemployment and estimate the marginal cost of each firm. Then probably we can estimate the Phillips curve from the firm perspective, with the variations at the firm level.

The shape and slope of this curve from the firm information reflects the trade off that firm faces between the increasing price or minimizing cost, which could help to explain the shape of the aggregate Phillips curve.

## Juan's thoughts.

Interesting. How do you plan to address reverse causality? i.e, firms layoff workers because they expect lower profit margins in the future?
